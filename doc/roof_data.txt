.      .        Format is the following:
.      .        hhhhhhhh hhhhssss

.      .        h = eave height in meters as 10.2 fixed point ('räystäskorkeus' in Finnish).
.      .        s = shape.

.      .        0 = flat ('tasakatto' in Finnish).
.      .        1 = skillion ('pulpettikatto' in Finnish; also needed: direction: 2 bits, and eave height ('räystäskorkeus' in Finnish)).
.      .        2 = gabled ('harjakatto' in Finnish; also needed direction: 1 bit, and eave height ('räystäskorkeus')).
.      .        3 = half-hipped (Also needed direction: 1 bit, and eave height ('räystäskorkeus'), and point P2).

.      .        6 = gambrel ('taitekatto' in Finnish; also needed direction: 1 bit, eave height ('räystäskorkeus'), and point P2).
.      .        7 = mansard ('mansardikatto' in Finnish; also needed direction: 1 bit, eave height ('räystäskorkeus'), and point P2 x 2).
.      .        8 = dome ('kupolikatto' in Finnish; also needed eave height ('räystäskorkeus'), and point P2. 2nd degree Bézier curve, 'quadratic Bézier curve')
.      .        9 = onion ('sipulikatto' in Finnish; also needed eave height ('räystäskorkeus'), and points P2 and P3. 3rd degree Bézier curve, 'cubic Bézier curve').
.      .        10 = round (Also needed direction: 1 bit, eave height ('räystäskorkeus'), and point P2. 2nd degree Bézier curve, 'quadratic Bézier curve').

If roof:shape is 'flat', then the struct ends here.
If roof:shape is something else, then the struct continues with the rest of the necessary information.

2      uint16_t If roof:shape is 'skillion' ('pulpettikatto' in Finnish), then:

.      .        rrrddhhh hhhhhhhh

.      .        r = reserved, must be 0.
.      .        d = direction of roof (2 bits).
.      .        h = relative height of roof ridge compared to eave height as 9.2 fixed point.

2      uint16_t If roof:shape is 'gabled' ('harjakatto' in Finnish), then:

.      .        rrrrdhhh hhhhhhhh

.      .        r = reserved, must be 0.
.      .        d = direction of roof.
.      .        h = relative height of roof ridge compared to eave height as 9.2 fixed point.

If roof:shape is 'skillion' ('pulpettikatto' in Finnish) tai 'gabled' ('harjakatto' in Finnish), then struct ends here.

2      uint32_t If roof:shape is 'half-hipped', then:

.      .        rreeeeee xxxxxxyy yyyydhhh hhhhhhhhh

.      .        r = reserved, must be 0.
.      .        e = position of end of roof ridge relative to building length. 0.6 fixed point. (0: no roof ridge, 1: full-length roof ridge).
.      .        x = katon taitepisteen x-koordinaatin sijainti suhteessa räystään ja katonharjan sijainteihin. 0.6 fixed point. TODO: translate into English!
.      .        y = katon taitepisteen y-koordinaatin sijainti suhteessa räystään ja katonharjan sijainteihin. 0.6 fixed point. TODO: translate into English!
.      .        d = direction of roof: 0 = north-south, 1 = east-west.
.      .        h = relative height of roof ridge compared to eave height as 9.2 fixed point.

2      uint32_t If roof:shape is 'hipped' ('aumakatto'), then:

.      .        rrrrrrrr rrrrrree eeeedhhh hhhhhhhhh

.      .        r = reserved, must be 0.
.      .        e = position of end of roof ridge relative to building length. 0.6 fixed point. (0: no roof ridge, 1: full-length roof ridge).

2      uint16_t If roof:shape is 'pyramidal' ('pyramidikatto'), then:

.      .        rrrrrhhh hhhhhhhh

.      .        h = relative height of roof ridge compared to eave height as 9.2 fixed point.

TODO: Add specification for the rest roof types!
