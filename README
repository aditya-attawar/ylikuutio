Ylikuutio 3D engine.

A hobby project of mine.

Some code is based on http://www.opengl-tutorial.org/ and is
under the license conditions stated on opengl-tutorial website.

My code is under The GNU General Public License 3, or
(at your option) any later version. See LICENSE file.

Suzanne the monkey is a standard Blender object.

Ylikuutio can be compiled on GCC or Visual Studio.
C++11 support is required.
cmake is needed for compiling process.
git is needed for downloading Google Test testing framework.

In Linux it's simple.
In Ylikuutio install directory:

$ mkdir build
$ cd build
$ cmake ..
$ make

If you have problems compiling tests or otherwise don't want
to compile tests, in CMakeLists.txt comment out the line that says:
set(DO_UNIT_TESTS_WITH_GOOGLE_TEST true)

There are some tests that use Catch testing framework but those tests
are now considered deprecated and Catch will not be used anymore for
testing in Ylikuutio. Tests using Catch have been disabled by default
in CMakeLists.txt .

To run Ajokki (working title based on Finnish bus body manufacturer),
a demo program so see some properties of Ylikuutio 3D engine:

$ ./ajokki

F to toggle flying on off, arrow keys work too.
F1 toggles help display and there you'll see some more options to try.

To run tests (coverage is still quite limited but underway):

$ ./unit_tests_with_Google_Test

Future developments underway:
o callbacks 
o in-game console
o partially transparent 2D text
o 3D text
o multiple scenes in the same world
o coordinates relative to other objects, not only to world object
o collision detection between objects
o octree space partitioning
o possibility to create scenes with different spatial scales
o objects (species in Ylikuutio terminology) with modifiable vertices
o making holes in objects
o splitting of objects into 2 or more pieces
o cementing of 2 or more objects into one
o morphing between objects (species in Ylikuutio terminology)
o morphing between objects (species) and 3D text (glyphs)
o ray casting for vertex selection and vertex modifications
o objects with 4 or more spatial dimensions,
  projected to 3D space before rendering to screen
o more shaders
o sky dome
o water
o more physics
o artificial intelligence (AI) creatures
o scripting language, possibly Bigloo
o visual pattern recognition for AI
