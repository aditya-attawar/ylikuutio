Ylikuutio can be compiled with GCC, Clang or Visual Studio.
C++11 support is required.
OpenGL 3.0 or newer is required.
CMake 2.6.2 or newer is needed for compiling process.
CMake uses git for downloading Google Test testing framework and Eigen,
a C++ template library for linear algebra.

In Linux it's simple.

First, install all the necessary compilers, tools and libs. You may use
your favorite package manager such as aptitude, apt-get, yum etc.
You all need these packages: cmake make g++ gcc libx11-dev libxi-dev libgl1-mesa-dev libglu1-mesa-dev libxcursor-dev libxrandr-dev libxext-dev libxi-dev libxinerama-dev
Eg. with aptitude:

$ sudo aptitude install cmake make g++ gcc libx11-dev libxi-dev libgl1-mesa-dev libglu1-mesa-dev libxcursor-dev libxrandr-dev libxext-dev libxi-dev libxinerama-dev

Then, to compile with GCC, in Ylikuutio install directory:

$ mkdir build
$ cd build
$ cmake ..
$ make

Or, to compile with Clang, again in Ylikuutio install directory:

$ mkdir build
$ cd build
$ export CC='/usr/bin/clang'
$ export CXX='/usr/bin/clang++'
$ cmake ..
$ make

If you have problems compiling tests or for some other reason don't want
to compile tests, in CMakeLists.txt comment out the line that says:
set(DO_UNIT_TESTS_WITH_GOOGLE_TEST true)

There are also tests which use Catch testing framework but those are now
considered deprecated and Catch will not be used for further testing in
Ylikuutio. Tests using Catch have been disabled by default but can be
compiled by uncommenting the corresponding line in CMakeLists.txt:
# set(DO_UNIT_TESTS_WITH_CATCH true)

To run Ajokki (working title based on Finnish bus body manufacturer),
a demo program to check out some properties of Ylikuutio 3D engine:

$ ./ajokki

F to toggle flying on off, arrow keys work too.
F1 toggles help display and there you'll see some more options to try.

To run tests (coverage is still quite limited but underway):

$ ./unit_tests_with_Google_Test

If you compiled tests using Catch framework (they are deprecated):

$ ./unit_tests_with_Catch

Implemented functionality:
o callbacks

Future developments underway:
o in-game console
o partially transparent 2D text
o 3D text
o multiple scenes in the same Universe
o coordinates relative to other objects, not only to Universe object
o collision detection between objects
o octree space partitioning
o possibility to create scenes with different spatial scales
o objects (species in Ylikuutio terminology) with modifiable vertices
o making holes in objects
o splitting of objects into 2 or more pieces
o cementing of 2 or more objects into one
o morphing between objects (Species in Ylikuutio terminology)
o morphing between objects (Species) and 3D text (Glyphs)
o ray casting for vertex selection and vertex modifications
o objects with 4 or more spatial dimensions,
  projected to 3D space before rendering to screen
o more shaders
o sky dome
o water
o more physics
o artificial intelligence (AI) creatures
o scripting language, possibly ChibiScheme
o visual pattern recognition for AI
