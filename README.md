## Compiling
Ylikuutio can be compiled with GCC, Clang or Visual Studio.
In Visual Studio the compiling may break due to compiler-specific bugs.
Cross compiling from Linux to Windows using GCC works fine.
C++14 support is required.
OpenGL 3.0 or newer is required.
CMake 2.6.2 or newer is needed for the compiling process.
CMake uses git for downloading Google Test testing framework.

In Linux it's simple.

First, install all the necessary compilers, tools and libs. You may use
your favorite package manager such as aptitude, apt-get, yum etc.
You all need these packages: cmake make g++ gcc libx11-dev libgl1-mesa-dev libglu1-mesa-dev libxcursor-dev libxrandr-dev libxext-dev libxi-dev libxinerama-dev
Eg. with aptitude:

    $ sudo aptitude install cmake build-essential libx11-dev libgl1-mesa-dev libglu1-mesa-dev libxcursor-dev libxrandr-dev libxext-dev libxi-dev libxinerama-dev

If you are doing a cross compile from Linux to Windows, you need also:

    $ sudo aptitude install g++-mingw-w64 gcc-mingw-w64 binutils-mingw-w64

If you are doing a cross compile from Linux to Android(TM), you need also:

    $ sudo aptitude install google-android-ndk-installer

However, cross compiling from Linux to Android does not work yet!

Then, to compile with GCC, in Ylikuutio install directory:

    $ mkdir build
    $ cd build
    $ cmake ..
    $ make

To make compiling faster you probably want to use several threads:

    $ make -j $(($(nproc) - 1))

Or, to compile with Clang, again in Ylikuutio install directory:

    $ mkdir build
    $ cd build
    $ export CC='/usr/bin/clang'
    $ export CXX='/usr/bin/clang++'
    $ cmake ..
    $ make

If you have problems compiling tests or for some other reason don't want
to compile tests, in CMakeLists.txt comment out the line that says:
`set(DO_UNIT_TESTS_WITH_GOOGLE_TEST true)`

To cross compile from Linux to Windows:

    $ mkdir build_windows
    $ cd build_windows
    $ cmake -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=../w64.cmake ..
    $ make

To cross compile from Linux to Android(TM) (using Android(TM) NDK):

    $ mkdir build_android
    $ cd build_android
    $ cmake -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=../android.cmake ..
    $ make

However, cross compiling from Linux to Android does not work yet!

Compiling in Visual Studio is more difficult. The recommended way to
get a binary for Windows is to cross compile from Linux to Windows.

To run Ajokki (working title based on Finnish bus body manufacturer),
a demo program to check out some properties of Ylikuutio 3D engine:

In Linux:

    $ ./ajokki

In Windows:

    > ajokki.exe

F to toggle flying on off, arrow keys work too.
F1 toggles help display and there you'll see some more options to try.

To run tests (coverage is still quite limited but underway):

    $ ./unit_tests_with_Google_Test

## Ylikuutio usage
This part reflects the current usage of Ylikuutio and will change as new
functionality is implemented.

At the moment, you need a main class (for an example, please see
`code/ajokki/ajokki.cpp`) which starts your game/simulation (initialization),
runs the game/simulation (the main loop) and ends the program (cleaning-up).
In all these phases mentioned above Ylikuutio library functions may be used.
Ylikuutio library code is located in `code/ylikuutio/` tree. Ylikuutio code
may change a lot and so far no API has been defined. Ajokki and Ylikuutio
code itself are the best references on how to use Ylikuutio in practice.

## FAQ
Q: What is "Ylikuutio"?
A: In Finnish, "yli" means "over", and "kuutio" means "cube".
   So, "Ylikuutio" is a reference to a hypercube.
   https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypercube

Q: How is Ylikuutio software developed?
A: In Debian GNU/Linux (Debian Stretch at the moment), using Vim.

Q: For what kinds of software Ylikuutio can be used?
A: Ylikuutio can be used for all kinds of 3D games and simulations.
   At the moment no specific support for 2D is available, but naturally
   3D graphics can also be used to present a 2D world.

Q: What are the design goals for Ylikuutio?
A: Ylikuutio aims to be a fast and flexible 3D game/simulation engine
   and fulfil my own requirements for my own indie game projects.

Q: What are the target platforms of Ylikuutio?
A: Ylikuutio targets Linux, Windows and Android, in this order.
   Cross-compiling from Linux to Windows works!
   Cross-compiling for Android is not implemented yet.
   Currently only 64-bit environments are supported.

Q: What graphics APIs Ylikuutio uses?
A: Ylikuutio targets OpenGL version 3.1, but so far 3.0 works too,
   ie. all currently used functionality is available in OpenGL 3.0.

Q: Are there plans to support other graphics APIs?
A: Newer OpenGL versions may be supported in the future, but so far
   OpenGL 3.1 fulfils my requirements.

Q: Does Ylikuutio use modern OpenGL (VBOs)?
A: Yes, Ylikuutio uses VBOs (vertex buffer objects) and VBO indexing.

Q: Is Ylikuutio based on some other 3D engine?
A: Some parts of Ylikuutio (shaders, some file loaders, etc.) are based
on http://www.opengl-tutorial.org/ , which I really recommend for anyone
interested in learning OpenGL programming. Ylikuutio also uses external
libraries such as TinyScheme, FastNoiseSIMD, GLEW, GLFW, GLM, and
pugixml. The rest is written from scratch.

Q: Why TinyScheme is chosen as the scripting language of Ylikuutio?
A: I like Lisp-family languages and TinyScheme fulfils my
   requirements related to a small size and a suitable license.
