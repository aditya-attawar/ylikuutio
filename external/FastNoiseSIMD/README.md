# FastNoise SIMD
FastNoise SIMD is the SIMD implementation of my noise library [FastNoise](https://github.com/Auburns/FastNoise). It aims to provide faster performance through the use of intrinsic(SIMD) CPU functions. Vectorisation of the code allows noise functions to process data in sets of 4 or 8 increasing performance by 300-400%.

After releasing FastNoise I got in contact with the author of [FastNoise SIMD](https://github.com/jackmott/FastNoise-SIMD) (naming is coincidence) and was inspired to work with SIMD functions myself. Through his code and discussions with him I created my implementation with even more optimisation thanks to the removal of lookup tables. 

Runtime detection of highest supported instruction set ensures the fastest possible performance with only 1 compile needed. If no support is found it will fallback to standard types (float/int).

##Features

- Value Noise 3D
- Gradient (Perlin) Noise 3D
- Simplex Noise 3D
- Multiple fractal options for all of the above
- White Noise 3D
- Cellular Noise 3D
- Large variety of cellular noise settings

##Supported Instruction Sets
- AVX2 - FMA3
- SSE4.1
- SSE2

More documentation coming soon.

#FastNoise SIMD Preview

I have written a compact testing application for all the features included in FastNoiseSIMD with a visual representation. I use this for development purposes and testing noise settings used in terrain generation. The fastest supported instruction set is also reported.

Download links can be found in the [Releases Section](https://github.com/Auburns/FastNoiseSIMD/releases).

#Performance Comparisons
Using default noise settings on FastNoise SIMD and matching those settings across the other libraries where possible.

Timing are averages of time taken for 1 million iterations on a single thread.
